The core functionality of this project is the "Text Image Generation Tool," named **WordCanvas**. This title translates to "Text Canvas," indicating its primary purpose.

By synthesizing data, we generate a vast array of diverse Chinese text images to address issues such as insufficient data volume, class imbalance, and lack of diversity. We drew inspiration from some existing text synthesis tools in designing our approach, which led us to create a new text image generator from scratch.
